        <Line>There is a narrow path through the cliffs by the waterfall. You might be able to sqeeze through there.</Line>
        <Line>But the land on the other side is controlled by savage warriors that don't take kindly to strangers.</Line>

        <Line>Well if you are sure, just head back into the forrest and keep to the left at the fork.</Line>
        <Line>That should lead you up to the waterfall. The opening in the cliff should be to the left of the waterfall probably covered by bushes.</Line>
        <Line>Or was it to the right? Hmm... Either way I would just stay here, much safer.</Line>
